Nordic Thingy:53 is a battery-operated prototyping platform for IoT Systems.

Thingy:53 integrates the following components:

* nRF5340 SoC - Supporting BluetoothÂ® Low Energy, 802.14.5 based protocols and Near Field Communication (NFC).
* nRF21540 RF FEM - Range extender with integrated power amplifier (PA)/low-noise amplifier (LNA).
* nPM1100 PMIC - Power Management IC with integrated dual-mode buck regulator and battery charger.

For more information on the product, see the `Thingy:53 product page`_ and the `Nordic Thingy:53 User Guide`_.
The |NCS| provides support for developing applications on the Thingy:53.

.. _thingy53_serialports:

Connecting to Thingy:53 serial ports
************************************

For connecting to Thingy:53, use a serial terminal.

Thingy:53 uses USB transport and CDC ACM class.
The CDC ACM baudrate is ignored, and transfer goes with USB speed.


Firmware
********

Nordic Thingy:53 comes preprogrammed with the Edge Impulse firmware, which allows the Thingy:53 to connect to Edge Impulse Studio over Bluetooth LE using the nRF Edge Impulse mobile application or through USB on your PC.
The firmware allows you to capture sensor data, which in turn you can use to train and test machine learning models in Edge Impulse Studio.
You can deploy trained machine learning models to the Nordic Thingy:53 through an over-the-air (OTA) update using Bluetooth LE or update over USB using nRF Connect Programmer.

See the `Nordic Semi Thingy:53 page`_ in the `Edge Impulse`_ documentation on how to use the Nordic Thingy:53 with the nRF Edge Impulse mobile application and Edge Impulse Studio.

There are also multiple samples in the |NCS| that you can run on the Nordic Thingy:53.

.. _thingy53_precompiled_fw:

Programming precompiled firmware images
***************************************

Precompiled firmware image files are useful in the following scenarios:

* Restoring the firmware to its initial image.
* Updating the application firmware to a newly released version.
* Testing different features of the Nordic Thingy:53.

Downloading precompiled firmware images
=======================================

To obtain precompiled images for updating the firmware, perform the following steps:

1. Go to the `Thingy:53 product page`_ and under the :guilabel:`Downloads` tab, navigate to :guilabel:`Precompiled applications`.
#. Download and extract the latest Thingy:53 firmware package.
#. Check the :file:`CONTENTS.txt` file in the extracted folder for the location and names of the different firmware images.

Quick programming of precompiled firmware images
================================================

When you have the precompiled images ready, you can directly program the images onto the Thingy:53 using the nRF Connect Programmer applecation available in nRF Connect for Desktop.

The Thingy:53 is connected directly to your PC through USB.
This method uses the :doc:`mcuboot:index` feature and the built-in serial recovery mode of Thingy:53.

You can also use the nRF Programmer mobile application for Android or iOS to update the firmware over-the-air (OTA) using Bluetooth Low Energy.

Alternatively, you can use an external debug probe, such as the nRF5340 DK, or any J-Link device supporting ARM Cortex-M33 to program firmware on a Thingy:53.

See `Updating Nordic Thingy:53 firmware`_ for the detailed procedures on how to program a Thingy:53 using nRF Connect Programmer or the nRF Programmer for Android or iOS.

.. _thingy53_building_pgming:

Building and programming from the source code
*********************************************

You can also program the Thingy:53 by using the images obtained by building the code in an |NCS| environment.

To set up your system to be able to build a compatible firmware image, follow the :ref:`getting_started` guide for |NCS|.
The build targets of interest for Thingy:53 in |NCS| are listed on the table below.
Note that building for the non-secure application core is not fully supported.

+--------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+

| :file:`dfu_application.zip`     | MCUboot compatible image, binary     | Using nRF Programmer for Android and iOS or nRF Connect Programmer |
+---------------------------------+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

There are multiple methods of programming a sample or application onto a Thingy:53.
You can choose the method based on the availability or absence of an external debug probe to program.

.. note::

   If you do not have an external debug probe available to program the Thingy:53, you can directly program compatible samples to the device over USB using the built-in MCUboot bootloader and nRF Connect Programmer.
   In this scenario, use the :file:`dfu_application.zip` file.

   Some compatible samples:

   * :ref:`nrf_machine_learning_app`
   * :ref:`matter_weather_station_app`
   * :ref:`peripheral_lbs`
   * :ref:`peripheral_uart`
   * :ref:`bluetooth_mesh_light`
   * :ref:`bluetooth_mesh_light_switch`

   #. Make sure that the Thingy:53 and the external debug probe are powered on.
   #. Click :guilabel:`Flash` in the :guilabel:`Actions` window.

Building and programming on the command line
********************************************

Before you start building |NCS| projects on the command line, you must :ref:`build_environment_cli`.

To build and program the source code from the command line, complete the following steps:

1. Open a command line or terminal window.
#. Go to the specific directory for the sample or application.

   For example, the full directory path is :file:`ncs/nrf/applications/machine_learning` when building the source code for the :ref:`nrf_machine_learning_app` application.

#. Make sure that you have the required version of the |NCS| repository by pulling the ``sdk-nrf`` repository on GitHub as described in :ref:`dm-wf-get-ncs` and :ref:`dm-wf-update-ncs` sections.
#. Get the rest of the dependencies using west::

      west update

#. Build the sample or application code as follows:

   .. parsed-literal::
      :class: highlight

      west build -b thingy53_nrf5340_cpuapp -d *destination_directory_name*

#. Program the sample or application:

   a. Connect the Thingy:53 to the debug out port on a 10-pin external debug probe, for example nRF5340 DK, using a 10-pin JTAG cable.
   #. Connect the external debug probe to the PC using a USB cable.
   #. Make sure that the Thingy:53 and the external debug probe are powered on.
   #. Use the following command to program the sample or application to the device::

         west flash

   The device resets and runs the programmed sample or application.
